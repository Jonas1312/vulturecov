[**vulturecov**](https://github.com/Jonas1312/vulturecov) is a tool to filter the dead code false positives found by [Vulture](https://github.com/jendrikseipp/vulture) using [Coverage.py](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/).

Vulture is a static analysis tool that finds unused code in Python programs. However, since Vulture is a static code analyzer, it is likely to miss some dead code. Foe example, code that is only called implicitly may be reported as unused.

Vulturecov uses Coverage.py to filter the dead code false positives found by Vulture: the rationale is that if a line of code is covered by a test, then it is unlikely to be dead code.

## Installation

```bash
pip install vulturecov
```

## Usage

First, generate the Vulture report:

```bash
vulture src/my_package > vulture_report.txt
vulture src/my_package whitelist.py > vulture_report.txt  # with a whitelist
```

Then, generate the Coverage report using pytest for example:

```bash
pytest --cov=src/my_package --cov-report=json:coverage.json
```

Once you have the two reports, you can use **vulturecov** to filter the Vulture report:

Show the dead code (lines of code that are found by Vulture and not covered by tests):

```bash
vulturecov vulture_report.txt coverage.json  # print the result to stdout
vulturecov vulture_report.txt coverage.json --output vulturecov_report.txt  # write the result to a file
```

Only show the false positives (lines of code that are covered by tests):

```bash
vulturecov vulture_report.txt coverage.json --false-positives  # print the result to stdout
vulturecov vulture_report.txt coverage.json --false-positives --output vulture_fp.txt  # write the result to a file
```

To add the false positives in your Vulture whitelist:

```bash
vulturecov vulture_report.txt coverage.json --false-positives >> whitelist.py
```
